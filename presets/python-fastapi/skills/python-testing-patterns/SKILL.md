# Python Testing Patterns

Comprehensive guide to implementing robust testing strategies in Python using pytest, fixtures, mocking, parameterization, and test-driven development practices.

## When to Use This Skill

- Writing unit tests for Python code
- Setting up test suites and test infrastructure
- Implementing test-driven development (TDD)
- Creating integration tests for APIs and services
- Mocking external dependencies and services
- Testing async code and concurrent operations
- Setting up continuous testing in CI/CD
- Implementing property-based testing
- Testing database operations
- Debugging failing tests

## Core Concepts

### 1. Test Types

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions/classes in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test interaction between components
- **Functional Tests**: Test complete features end-to-end
- **Performance Tests**: Measure speed and resource usage

### 2. Test Structure (AAA Pattern)

- **Arrange**: Set up test data and preconditions
- **Act**: Execute the code under test
- **Assert**: Verify the results

### 3. Test Coverage

- Measure what code is exercised by tests
- Identify untested code paths
- Aim for meaningful coverage, not just high percentages

### 4. Test Isolation

- Tests should be independent
- No shared state between tests
- Each test should clean up after itself

## Quick Start

```python
# test_example.py
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def test_add():
    """Basic test example."""
    result = add(2, 3)
    assert result == 5

def test_add_negative():
    """Test with negative numbers."""
    assert add(-1, 1) == 0

# Run with: pytest test_example.py
```

## Resources

- **pytest documentation**: https://docs.pytest.org/
- **unittest.mock**: https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html
- **hypothesis**: Property-based testing
- **pytest-asyncio**: Testing async code
- **pytest-cov**: Coverage reporting
- **pytest-mock**: pytest wrapper for mock

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Write tests first** (TDD) or alongside code
2. **One assertion per test** when possible
3. **Use descriptive test names** that explain behavior
4. **Keep tests independent** and isolated
5. **Use fixtures** for setup and teardown
6. **Mock external dependencies** appropriately
7. **Parametrize tests** to reduce duplication
8. **Test edge cases** and error conditions
9. **Measure coverage** but focus on quality
10. **Run tests in CI/CD** on every commit

## Reference Files

Load only the file you need for the task at hand:

- `references/patterns.md` — fixtures, parametrization, mocking, async tests, custom markers
- `references/best-practices.md` — test design, naming, isolation, what to assert, coverage
- `references/integration.md` — database fixtures, CI pipelines, pytest.ini / pyproject config
